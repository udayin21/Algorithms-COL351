# Algorithms-COL351
My course 'Design and Analysis of Algorithms' gives us 6 programming assignments.
(1)Even path vertices: to find all the vertices that are at an even path from a source vertex. Concept: DFS-Graph theory

(2)Greedy allocation of matrix: to fill a matrix with 0s and 1s to fulfill rowSum and colSum. Concept: Greedy algorithm

(3) Long multiplication vs Karatsuba: to multiply 2 n bit numbers and compare their time complexity. Concept: Divide and conquer. To be uploaded soon.

Problem statements available as pdfs within folders.
